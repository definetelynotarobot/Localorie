# Localorie

Localorie is a start-up idea that consists of supporting local farmers in certain areas of Turkey by providing them world wide chain of distribution.

Localorie is built with HTML5&CSS and Bootstrap 4.6 and it is a responsive website that can function perfect in both tablets and mobile phones!

Building this website was fun but also challenging. I learned a lot about Bootstrap and how to include elements(google maps, buttons, images)in my website.
